# K-means Clustering and Silhouette Scoring from Scratch

K-means clustering and silhouette scoring algorithms are implemented from scratch and results visually presented. 
You can generate your own (convex/non-convex) dataset using this repository.
The code to compare with sklearn's ready implementation is also included.

Example plots are as follows:
